{"name":"Farling","type":"feat","img":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KibblesTasty/kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation/archive/VTTTokens/Farling.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Farlings are a race that comes from beyond the material plane, though few are certain where. While humanoid in shape, they are immediately distinguished from mortal races. They have a slender build, large eyes, and tendrils in place of hair. Their strange nature and inherent psionic abilities make them easily feared, but they tend to be far more friendly to mortal races than most of that which comes from the beyond.</p>\n<p>Farlings tend to be blue to purple, but can be more exotic colors, or even have strange and exotic colorations and patterns in some cases. The nature and location of their creation results in little consistency of exact appearance, though they will often have some traits of their progenitor (such as sharing an eye or skin coloration).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Adaptable Mind</h2>\n<p>Farlings are exceedingly adept at picking up social cues and cultural norms, and despite their strange appearance can easily fit into a tolerant society, but often maintain exceedingly strange senses of humor and behavior, fully aware of its oddity, sometimes even playing up their alien nature. They enjoy seeing the reactions of other creatures to strange circumstances, even if they have to cause those situations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Memory and Aging</h2>\n<p>Farlings age by gaining memories. They do not biologically age, but have the ability to make permanent crystalized memories, and age roughly one day each time they do. Young Farlings make these memories a dozen times a day, aging rapidly while absorbing new information at an incredible rate, while aging Farlings become more selective in what they choose to remember. If they do not commit some memory in this way, their memory tends to be still somewhat better than a human, but they view these memories as transient things that will be eventually forgotten.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Nature and Biology</h2>\n<p>Farlings do not have a gender, though those that travel among other races may associate with one. They have a generally androgynous and alien apparence. They are capable of forming strong emotional bonds, though some (particularly younger ones) will find the idea of gender and the associated customs hilarious (potentially inappropriately so based on the culture). Farlings that exist for hundreds of years and absorb thousands of memories can create a new Farling by traveling to realms of mind and thought where reality is more flexible, and psionically willing a new one into existence.</p>\n<p>A newly created Farling is often left to experience the world on their own shortly after the creation, left with associates or friends of its creator (that they have hopefully made arrangements with) who will then move on, seeking to let the new Farling develop on its own, often seeking to not influence their experiences more than necessary.</p>\n<p>Taking care of a young Farling can be exhausting due to the rampant curiosity and inquisitive nature rapidly consuming new experiences and memories, but their inquisitive nature causes them to age exceedingly quickly. A young Farling can fully absorb many memories a day, aging exceedingly fast.

Each time they permanently absorb a memory, they age roughly one day. A young Farling can absorb dozens of memories a day, aging rapidly. Once reaching adulthood (a process that often only takes a decade), the rate at which they can absorb memories begins to slow, they become more selective, aging far slower.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Old Age</strong></h3>\n<p>If a Farling can die of old age is unknown.

They can be the artisanal masterpiece of a Golemsmith, or perhaps a relic of a mass production of an ancient lost civilization... or perhaps not-so-lost a civilization. Their source and purpose will vary greatly. Were they made with sapience in mind, or did they gain it later? Were they made for labor or war?</p>\n<p>Some Ironwrought will dwell on these questions and what it means for them to exist outside of the boundary of their original purpose, but many simply move on, acquiring new parameters to live their life from those they interact with, finding their purpose in life as any of their more fleshy counterparts might.</p>\n<p>How they are treated in society will vary based on how common they are. In settings where Ironwrought created for labor are common, they will generally be treated quite neutrally, while they may be treated with greater fear or concern if Ironwrought were primarily created as war machines, though in both cases they might be mistaken for their last sapient cousins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Self Aware</h2>\n<p>While most constructs are not truly self aware, an Ironwrought is a special case of a cosntruct that has attained a full degree of self-awareness... sometimes in a more rudimentary way, sometimes as self-aware as any human. How that occurred is often dependent on your origin. Here is a table of some origins of your self-awareness. You can roll on the following table, pick one that suits your character, or select a different reason entirely based on your game’s setting and character’s backstory.</p>\n<h3><strong>Origin of Sapience</strong></h3>\n<table style=\"width:100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\"><strong>d8</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\"><strong>Origin</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">You existed without self awareness for years before a magical accident rendered you self aware.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">You were a new experiment, designed for more complicated tasks, and ended up more sapient than expected.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">Left to a mindless task for hundreds of years in a long abandoned location, you slowly developed a sense of self until you abandoned your programmed task.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">Your sapience is the result of the influence of a supernatural being (celestial, fey, or even fiend) granting you self-awareness for their purposes (or entertainment).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.892%\">5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:84.108%\">You awoke from a long hibernation changed, with greater self awareness.

In some cases they are humanoids that have been bound to an Ironwrought, melancholy about their new metalbound existence. Other times they have a pragmatic nature unconcerned with the unknowable trivialities, focused on the here and now. Ironwrought most frequently have pragmatic personalities that are inclined to logical outcomes.

{"name":"Farling","type":"feat","img":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KibblesTasty/kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation/archive/VTTTokens/Farling.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Farlings are a race that comes from beyond the material plane, though few are certain where. While humanoid in shape, they are immediately distinguished from mortal races. They have a slender build, large eyes, and tendrils in place of hair. Their strange nature and inherent psionic abilities make them easily feared, but they tend to be far more friendly to mortal races than most of that which comes from the beyond.</p>\n<p>Farlings tend to be blue to purple, but can be more exotic colors, or even have strange and exotic colorations and patterns in some cases. The nature and location of their creation results in little consistency of exact appearance, though they will often have some traits of their progenitor (such as sharing an eye or skin coloration).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Adaptable Mind</h2>\n<p>Farlings are exceedingly adept at picking up social cues and cultural norms, and despite their strange appearance can easily fit into a tolerant society, but often maintain exceedingly strange senses of humor and behavior, fully aware of its oddity, sometimes even playing up their alien nature. They enjoy seeing the reactions of other creatures to strange circumstances, even if they have to cause those situations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Memory and Aging</h2>\n<p>Farlings age by gaining memories. They do not biologically age, but have the ability to make permanent crystalized memories, and age roughly one day each time they do. Young Farlings make these memories a dozen times a day, aging rapidly while absorbing new information at an incredible rate, while aging Farlings become more selective in what they choose to remember. If they do not commit some memory in this way, their memory tends to be still somewhat better than a human, but they view these memories as transient things that will be eventually forgotten.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Nature and Biology</h2>\n<p>Farlings do not have a gender, though those that travel among other races may associate with one. They have a generally androgynous and alien apparence. They are capable of forming strong emotional bonds, though some (particularly younger ones) will find the idea of gender and the associated customs hilarious (potentially inappropriately so based on the culture). Farlings that exist for hundreds of years and absorb thousands of memories can create a new Farling by traveling to realms of mind and thought where reality is more flexible, and psionically willing a new one into existence.</p>\n<p>A newly created Farling is often left to experience the world on their own shortly after the creation, left with associates or friends of its creator (that they have hopefully made arrangements with) who will then move on, seeking to let the new Farling develop on its own, often seeking to not influence their experiences more than necessary.</p>\n<p>Taking care of a young Farling can be exhausting due to the rampant curiosity and inquisitive nature rapidly consuming new experiences and memories, but their inquisitive nature causes them to age exceedingly quickly. A young Farling can fully absorb many memories a day, aging exceedingly fast. It is usually not long before they seek to wander broader environments, and set out into the world.</p>\n<p>Farlings are not aquatic, but are unusually suited to it, often finding water quite comfortable and are natural swimmers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Dark Reflection</strong></h3>\n<p>Some Farlings become addicted to acquiring memories, and particularly savor those from other creatures. While a player character can only absorb memories from a willing creature, some stories tell of Farlings that have fallen into evil ways, ripping and devouring the memories from mortal creatures compulsively devouring their memories until nothing is left, savoring the exotic memories they discover.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Quirks</strong></h3>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:163px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:16.1401%;text-align:center;height:16px\"><strong>d6</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:83.8599%;text-align:center;height:16px\"><strong>Quirks</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:16.1401%;text-align:center;height:16px\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:83.8599%;text-align:center;height:16px\">You ask blunt personal questions of strangers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:33px\">\n<td style=\"width:16.1401%;text-align:center;height:33px\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:83.8599%;text-align:center;height:33px\">You go to great lengths to try strange food.

Those that interact with members of other races will adopt an assumed name, running the gambit from common and boring to outlandish and absurd. Their name often reflects the culture they most interacted with when finding they needed a name that could be made with sounds.</p>\n<p>They rarely place great importance in their name, occasionally changing it or accepting a new nickname without much thought, as they don’t particularly associate the name with themselves; to them, that’s merely what people call them.</p>\n<p><strong>Farling Names:</strong> Blue, Dustin, Jonny, Lulu, Newbie, Pattern, Purple, Rey, Sala, Stripes, Squid, Thomas, Uanqor, Quentin, Yara, Yldel, Wis.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Completely Random</strong></h3>\n<p>If it seems like these names are random, it is because they are. There is no pattern to Farling names beyond the nature of creatures naming them, sometimes being simply descriptive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n<p>As a farling, your character has the following traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase. </strong>Your Intelligence score, Wisdom score, and Charisma score all increase by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Age. </strong>A Farling ages by absorbing memories. Each time they permanently absorb a memory, they age roughly one day. A young Farling can absorb dozens of memories a day, aging rapidly. Once reaching adulthood (a process that often only takes a decade), the rate at which they can absorb memories begins to slow, they become more selective, aging far slower.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Old Age</strong></h3>\n<p>If a Farling can die of old age is unknown. They become far more selective about absorbing memories as they grow older, often losing their curious nature and becoming withdrawn from society after absorbing thousands of memories, ruminating on what they have experienced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Alignment.</strong> Farlings show little consistency in alignment, and are shaped by their circumstances and background. Their curious and impulsive nature often leads younger members of the race to exhibit chaotic tendencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Size. </strong>Most Farlings stand between 5 and 6 feet tall, with a slighter build than humans. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Aberration.</strong> Your creature type is Aberration, rather than humanoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet. You have a swimming speed of 20 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages. </strong>You can speak, read, and write Common, Deep Speech, and one extra language of your choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Adaptive Intuition. </strong>You gain proficiency in Insight, and have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine social cues or cultural customs. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.e9BYCDEBhAFD6RoF]{Farling: Adaptive Intuition}</p>\n<p><strong>Psionic Mind.</strong> You gain the Telepathy Discipline of the psion, though you can’t use the Alternate Effects unless you gain this Discipline from another source. If you gain this Discipline from another source, you gain 1 additional psi point instead. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.2lF35KsDRkUycM2A]{Farling: Psionic Mind}</p>\n<p><strong>Crystalized Memory.</strong> When you learn or experience something, you can fix that memory, making it a permanent memory you can always remember with crystal clarity. This memory can be anything that occurs within a 1 hour span (it can be as short as a fleeting sensation, or as long as 1 hour of events). @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.l3M5C9cqaNS30Uku]{Farling: Crystalized Memory}</p>\n<p>Once you do this, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Absorbing these memories is how a Farling ages, and you age one day for each memory you absorb in this way. You can absorb a memory from a willing creature via your telepathy in this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Broad Horizons.</strong> You have resistance to psychic damage. Once per day, if take psychic damage from a critical hit, you can choose to absorb that damage as a memory, taking no damage. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.QkF4VLAkKK0MmiWT]{Farling: Broad Horizons}</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Absorption.</strong> Your rapid ability to learn new skills grants you proficiency in one artisan tool and one skill of your choice. At your GM’s discretion, if your game allows for the training in tools and skills, you may gain proficiency in them twice as fast using your Crystalized Memory feature daily. @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-races.CtMstMkkYBebsk86]{Farling: Skill Absorption}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Variant Farling</h2>\n<p>At the discrection of your GM, the following is an intended feature of Farlings that can be added in place of Skill Absorption. This is a recommended feature to allow additional options, but may not be suited for all games due to interacterations with other custom rules at some tables:</p>\n<p><strong>Alien Mind.</strong> When you gain the Spellcasting or Psionics ability from any class or feature, you can change the associated ability score to your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.

They can be the artisanal masterpiece of a Golemsmith, or perhaps a relic of a mass production of an ancient lost civilization... or perhaps not-so-lost a civilization. Their source and purpose will vary greatly. Were they made with sapience in mind, or did they gain it later? Were they made for labor or war?</p>\n<p>Some Ironwrought will dwell on these questions and what it means for them to exist outside of the boundary of their original purpose, but many simply move on, acquiring new parameters to live their life from those they interact with, finding their purpose in life as any of their more fleshy counterparts might.</p>\n<p>How they are treated in society will vary based on how common they are. In settings where Ironwrought created for labor are common, they will generally be treated quite neutrally, while they may be treated with greater fear or concern if Ironwrought were primarily created as war machines, though in both cases they might be mistaken for their last sapient cousins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Self Aware</h2>\n<p>While most constructs are not truly self aware, an Ironwrought is a special case of a cosntruct that has attained a full degree of self-awareness... sometimes in a more rudimentary way, sometimes as self-aware as any human.
