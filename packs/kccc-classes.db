Cursesmith, Fleshsmith, Gadgetsmith, Golemsmith, Infusionsmith, Potionsmith, Relicsmith, Thundersmith, or Warsmith, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 5th, and 14th level.</p>\n<h2>General Upgrades</h2>\n<p>The following generic upgrades are available to all subclasses, and can be selected in place of any subclass upgrade:</p>\n<p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.te61fHUl19wp18S9]{Inventor Upgrade: Shield Proficiency}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.MuChUKPaPQQPAdqU]{Inventor Upgrade: Tool Proficiency}</p>\n<h2>Potionsmith</h2>\n<p>A potionsmith is an inventor who has pursued the secrets of alchemy. While many a village has an apothecary grinding odd herbs and roots into potent (or not so potent) concoctions, the careful process of mixing and brewing is just one way to achieve results. Through the use of the intricate secrets of the craft and direct infusions using magical rituals, a potionsmith can come up with explosive results in the blink of an eye... sometimes literally.</p>\n<p>A potionsmith can be a scholar who has delved into the knowledge the world has to offer or an explorer that has unlocked the secrets of the wilderness. Their knowledge could come from being friends of the fey or from unfettered access to the royal library. As such, potionsmith’s can be good or evil, lawful or chaotic.</p>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.3Ervz8Gob3s0cpw2]{Potionsmith’s Proficiency},

Cursesmith, Fleshsmith, Gadgetsmith, Golemsmith, Infusionsmith, Potionsmith, Relicsmith, Thundersmith, or Warsmith, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 5th, and 14th level.</p>\n<h2>General Upgrades</h2>\n<p>The following generic upgrades are available to all subclasses, and can be selected in place of any subclass upgrade:</p>\n<p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.te61fHUl19wp18S9]{Inventor Upgrade: Shield Proficiency}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.MuChUKPaPQQPAdqU]{Inventor Upgrade: Tool Proficiency}</p>\n<h2>Gadgetsmith</h2>\n<p>A gadgetsmith is an inventor whose curiosity and inventive genius have run rampant. While other inventors may spend their whole career perfecting a single-minded pursuit, a gad- getsmith believes that quantity is at least as good as quality.</p>\n<p>Quick footed and even quicker witted, gadgetsmiths are never caught without another trick up their sleeve—their minds always jumping ahead to solve the next problem with a clever contraption.</p>\n<p>A gadgetsmith can come from any walk of life, but they usually exemplify curiosity and a distaste for the suppression of knowledge or technology, usually favoring freedom to experiment and leaning toward more chaotic behaviors.</p>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.Hdt8XqZz7U7qanIy]{Essential Tools}</p>\n<p>3rd Level: <span
