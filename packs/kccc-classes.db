Cursesmith, Fleshsmith, Gadgetsmith, Golemsmith, Infusionsmith, Potionsmith, Relicsmith, Thundersmith, or Warsmith, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 5th, and 14th level.</p>\n<h2>General Upgrades</h2>\n<p>The following generic upgrades are available to all subclasses, and can be selected in place of any subclass upgrade:</p>\n<p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.te61fHUl19wp18S9]{Inventor Upgrade: Shield Proficiency}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.MuChUKPaPQQPAdqU]{Inventor Upgrade: Tool Proficiency}</p>\n<h2>Infusionsmith</h2>\n<p>An infusionsmith is, in some ways, perhaps the most quintessen-</p>\n<p>tial type of inventor. While other inventors may delve into mech-</p>\n<p>anics and tinkering, an infusionsmith tinkers with magic itself.</p>\n<p>These inventors are on the cutting edge of magical engineering, understanding the principal applications of magic. Infusionsmiths would have ground to stand on in calling a wizard an impulsive spellslinger, for they are the inventors that work their magic through careful and meticulous study, laying down magic they may not use for hours, or painstakingly crafting a long-lasting enchantment.</p>\n<p>An infusionsmith can be a magical swordsman, a wandslinger, or a bookish supporting character with a bagful of tricks that never quite runs dry. Some will stand within a maelstrom of animated blades, while others will plink away with a crossbow that seems unerringly accurate, but their common theme is using their prowess of infusion to make themselves formidable.</p>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.PJ8Iq4pkphER3Rhb]{Infusionsmith’s Proficiency},

Unleashed Mind, Transcended Mind, Shaper’s Mind, Wandering Mind, or Consuming Mind, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description.

The life of an Unleashed Psion is frequently their journey to control their unruly powers... or one of embracing the destructive powers fully.</p>\n<p>What the wellspring of their innate power is varies: they could be a psionic race, born under the influence of distant twisted powers, warped by fey blood, or a herald of something more sinister brushing against the material world. Sometimes their power will show itself in simple applications, but most often their power becomes known and feared when their temper flares.</p>\n<p>Their alignment frequently depends on the approach to their powers they have taken. An Unleashed Psion who emphasizes control and restraint, keeping their emotions from running wild and their powers from running rampant will most often be lawful, following strict personal codes. On the other hand, an Unleashed Psion who lets their power run rampant will almost always be chaotic in nature, acting on impulse... with great emphasis.</p>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.eqtXoFfy2ht1vjmw]{Unshackled Power} @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.CfDJqyWcthOzPlI7]{Overwhelming Power}</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">3rd Level: </span>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.qlI6WV7zeJOAZggS]{Rampaging Power}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.LN3iejXbKb8X3NA1]{Empowered Psionics}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.StLx5aNWyW4RUtK2]{Uncontrollable Mind}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.CHVwK9pLHmfTqZmQ]{Unstoppable Rampage}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Kibbles' Compendium of Craft and Creation","identifier":"","levels":1,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["dec","his","ins","itm","inv","med","prc","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"int"},"subclass":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ZltBRX3qCs8ZDdsL":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.6VoZrWxhOEKGYhnq"}}}

Unleashed Mind, Transcended Mind, Shaper’s Mind, Wandering Mind, or Consuming Mind, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Mind</h2>\n<p>An Awakened Mind is a psion who had their psionic power awakened within them by an encounter, event, or circumstance. Perhaps their powers were latent or perhaps their destiny had been that of a normal creature until powers were suddenly thrust on them. Perhaps they brushed the realms beyond in a vivid dream, perhaps they wandered the Feywild and came back warped, perhaps they merely glimpsed the eyes of a creature that did not belong walking down the street.</p>\n<p>An awakening is often somewhat traumatic. Psions are not well understood and the first power they manifest—telepathy—is one of the most feared and shunned abilities.</p>\n<p>An Awakened can be either empathetic or cruel, good or evil.

Cursesmith, Fleshsmith, Gadgetsmith, Golemsmith, Infusionsmith, Potionsmith, Relicsmith, Thundersmith, or Warsmith, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 5th, and 14th level.</p>\n<h2>General Upgrades</h2>\n<p>The following generic upgrades are available to all subclasses, and can be selected in place of any subclass upgrade:</p>\n<p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.te61fHUl19wp18S9]{Inventor Upgrade: Shield Proficiency}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.MuChUKPaPQQPAdqU]{Inventor Upgrade: Tool Proficiency}</p>\n<h2>Gadgetsmith</h2>\n<p>A gadgetsmith is an inventor whose curiosity and inventive genius have run rampant. While other inventors may spend their whole career perfecting a single-minded pursuit, a gad- getsmith believes that quantity is at least as good as quality.</p>\n<p>Quick footed and even quicker witted, gadgetsmiths are never caught without another trick up their sleeve—their minds always jumping ahead to solve the next problem with a clever contraption.</p>\n<p>A gadgetsmith can come from any walk of life, but they usually exemplify curiosity and a distaste for the suppression of knowledge or technology, usually favoring freedom to experiment and leaning toward more chaotic behaviors.</p>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation.kccc-classes.Hdt8XqZz7U7qanIy]{Essential Tools}</p>\n<p>3rd Level: <span
