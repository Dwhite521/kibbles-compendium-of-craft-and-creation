You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another bookâ€”for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<h2>Order of Creation</h2>\n<p>Wizards that belong to this order of thought seek to advance the application of magic through the merging of mechanical and magical pieces. They share much in common with Inventors in mind set, but delve deeper into the knowledge of magic, relying more heavily on it to power their mechanical inventions, and in turn creating mechanical inventions that more primarily serve to further their magic.</p>\n<p>They often seek to look beyond tradition and common knowledge, to seek out new spells and new ways of doing things. The value of new research and new technology is often more than dusty old tomes unless those dusty old tomes contain secrets of those who had reached the heights they seek in ages gone by.</p>\n<p>2nd: @Item[1iRd8fcBZdysYGMV]{Crafting Fundamentals}</p>\n<p>2nd: @Item[gtW8Ezg14fxlwPK9]{Arcane Automaton}</p>\n<p>2nd: @Item[Hy1MQ2LH2v0YB4t1]{Arcane Gadget}</p>\n<p>6th: @Item[VFS5wBQKsajtkRye]{Imbued Gear}</p>\n<p>6th: @Item[MUz2bDpZt8zRI0xr]{Reverse Engineer}</p>\n<p>10th : @Item[MLIZJAgiVnpojoF1]{Clever Creation}</p>\n<p>14th: @Item[UMRGDa5cZ9EKFsLk]{Creatorâ€™s Vision}</p>\n<h3><strong>Order of Creation Quirks</strong></h3>\n<p>The following are some optional quirks for a player that selects Order of Creation.

Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p>\n<h1>Druid Circles</h1>\n<h2>Circle of Nightmares</h2>\n<p>Druids are often thought of as the guardians of the natural order and having a deep connection to the creatures of the land. Sometimes that connection goes horribly wrong. A druid of this circle has found their mind entangled with the horrors of the beyond, their natural connection to nature and its beasts becoming warped by the dark dreams.</p>\n<p>Druids of this circle may be haunted by the terrors they see, but many simply find their minds inoculated against the horror (perhaps by the touch of madness). Some even treat twisted abominations with the same care other druids might take to vicious and wild animals, treating them with pragmatic understanding and empathy</p>\n<p>Sometimes their connection even seems to be mutual.</p>\n<p>2nd Level: @Item[lsF9y5PrvU33XRbi]{Circle of Nightmares Spells}</p>\n<p>2nd Level: @Item[5veqL8A7QgO2O78Z]{Eldritch Mutation}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Item[5veqL8A7QgO2O78Z]{Eldritch Mutation}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Item[t7YR6xK4gjWZ1H2H]{Faceted Forms}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Item[dSqsDUzOfcUfdQUu]{Piercing Eyes}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Item[Z8AgM3iQ3K9hWwtI]{Mutation Mastery}</p>\n<h3><strong>Circle of Nightmare Quicks</strong></h3>\n<p>The following are some optional quirks for a player of the Circle of Nightmares.

You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.

This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.
